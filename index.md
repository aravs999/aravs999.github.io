### CPSC 120-01

* Lab 7

   Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorites because I was always interested in legal Blackjack
   gambling. I was excited to write functions that could correctly calculate the correct
   value of the hand even with all of the Aces.

* Lab 8

   Lab 8, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to write a loop that created a cool
   pattern design. It also made me use my brain a little bit to figure out how it works, so
   I had to think about how to use what I had learned already.

* Lab 9

   Lab 9, part 2 was my favorite because I was able to write code that would be used to guess 
   a secret number in a file. I've always liked guessing games since I was a child.
